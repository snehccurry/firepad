Windows phone was an example of excellence engineering and taste, you can't ignore the fact that it's design, camera, animations, sound effects were ahead of it's time, it was the first phone 
to implement always on display, it was the first company to implement 48mp camera in a phone that too 10 years ago. It was well optimized too. it failed. 


Well in one line if i had to cramp it down, i'd say it had the best experience packed in a phone, with live tiles, UI and all the other things I mentioned.

I'm on a mission to bring it back, not everyone understands a good taste or may be it was a genuine marketing mistake, which I know is. 


Well, Well, Well. I'm here to revive it. it was my brother's phone but then i loved that typing experience,
with those same sound effects, and i'm thrilled to announce that I've managed to get those sound effects for your keyboard, it's just amazing. 
so, here's another project in your name firegirl. 

here's Firepad.

It has all the sound effects from windows phone.
